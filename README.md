# Automated AI Review Rating Prediction System

## Project Overview
This project aims to build an end-to-end Artificial Intelligence system that predicts product review ratings (1–5 stars) based on customer review text. The system leverages Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Transformer-based NLP models to analyze large-scale e-commerce reviews.

## Internship Objective
As part of the internship program, this project demonstrates:
- Large-scale dataset handling (500,000+ reviews)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with business insights
- Multiple model training and comparison
- Performance evaluation using industry metrics
- Deployment-ready inference pipeline
